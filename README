I built this ember.js app to show how you would use a custom mixin for

pagination
filtering (not yet implemented)
sorting (not yet implemented)

To run this django application

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python manage.py syncdb --noinput
3. python manage.py runserver

If you are just stopping by to see the ember.js part of the app here is the javascript

Here is the pagination mixin used in the ArrayController shown in the above ember.js app
